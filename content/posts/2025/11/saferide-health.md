After nearly three years with SafeRide Health, I can confidently say this is the most rewarding and challenging position of my career. What started as an opportunity to work with familiar technologies quickly evolved into a transformative journey that pushed me far beyond my comfort zone—and I wouldn't have it any other way.

## When Did This Journey Begin?

I joined SafeRide Health in February 2022, bringing over a decade of experience in PHP and Laravel development. At the time, I was seeking a role that would challenge me intellectually while respecting my commitment to work-life balance as a father of a large, busy family. SafeRide Health has exceeded those expectations in every way.

## What Makes SafeRide Health Exceptional?

### The Challenge Factor

I thrive on intellectual challenges—not necessarily daily, but consistently enough to keep me engaged and growing. SafeRide Health has challenged me beyond my expectations from day one.

When I started, the company was operating several legacy PHP/Laravel monolithic applications. These codebases, while functional, represented the technical debt of rapid early-stage growth. The engineering team had ambitious plans to modernize the architecture, and I was brought on to help lead that transformation.

### Work-Life Balance That Actually Works

As someone with a large family, work-life balance isn't just a nice-to-have—it's essential. SafeRide Health has mastered the art of results-oriented work culture. Whether you're most productive in the early morning hours or late at night, the company focuses on output and communication rather than arbitrary schedules. As long as you deliver quality work and keep your team informed about your availability, you have the flexibility to structure your day around your life.

This trust-based approach has allowed me to be present for my family while contributing meaningfully to challenging technical projects.

## The Microservices Transformation

### From Monoliths to Modern Architecture

The migration from monolithic applications to microservices has been one of the most significant technical challenges of my career. This wasn't just a technology upgrade—it was a fundamental rethinking of how we build and deploy software.

We chose TypeScript running on Deno 2.x as our primary stack for microservices. This decision brought several advantages:

- **Type safety across services**: TypeScript's robust type system helps us catch errors at compile time rather than in production
- **Modern runtime**: Deno 2.x provides built-in TypeScript support, secure defaults, and excellent developer experience
- **Performance**: The microservices architecture allows us to scale individual components independently based on demand
- **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused services are easier to understand, test, and update

### Learning TypeScript at Scale

When I joined, my expertise was firmly rooted in PHP and Laravel. The shift to TypeScript required rapid upskilling. I requested access to Matt Pocock's TotalTypescript course, and it proved invaluable. The course's practical approach and comprehensive coverage allowed me to become productive in TypeScript within months rather than years.

### The Reality of Architectural Evolution

Not every decision we made during the migration was perfect. We've encountered technical debt from our own choices and have had to refactor or completely redesign certain services. This iterative process has taught me that good architecture isn't about making perfect decisions—it's about making informed decisions and being willing to course-correct when needed.

The key is building systems that are resilient enough to evolve. We've successfully removed several architectural anti-patterns from our codebase, and we continue to refine our approach as we learn.

## Building a World-Class Engineering Team

### Continuous Learning Culture

As a Lead Engineer, I expected to be the primary teacher on the team. Instead, I find myself learning something new almost every week from my colleagues. This wasn't what I anticipated, and it's been one of the most valuable aspects of working at SafeRide Health.

The team comprises experts in various domains:

- **Backend architecture specialists** who understand distributed systems at a deep level
- **Frontend engineers** who craft exceptional user experiences
- **DevOps experts** who have built robust pipelines and infrastructure
- **Data engineers** who help us make informed decisions through analytics

Each engineer brings unique strengths, but together we form something greater than the sum of our parts. Code reviews become learning opportunities. Design discussions become masterclasses in system thinking.

### Collaborative Problem-Solving

SafeRide Health has cultivated a culture where finger-pointing simply doesn't exist. When production issues arise—and they inevitably do in any complex system—the focus is entirely on collaboration and resolution.

If a bug makes it to production, it doesn't matter who wrote the code or who approved the pull request. The entire team rallies to understand the root cause, implement a fix, and prevent similar issues in the future. This blameless culture has created an environment where engineers feel safe taking calculated risks and innovating without fear.

## Living Our Core Values

Company values often feel like hollow corporate speak—words on a wall that rarely influence day-to-day work. SafeRide Health is different. Our core values aren't just aspirational statements; they're the foundation of how we operate.

### Take The Wheel

> *We take action. When faced with a problem, take the wheel, identify and drive the solution, and then share it with your team.*

This value resonates deeply with how SafeRide Health operates in practice. I've lost count of the times I've been working on a feature, noticed problematic code or architecture, and taken the initiative to refactor it—even when it wasn't part of my assigned ticket.

The response? Encouragement, not criticism.

There's an understanding that improving the codebase is everyone's responsibility. Of course, you need to balance scope creep against delivery timelines. If a refactoring is too large for the current sprint, we create a backlog ticket to address it properly later. But the autonomy to improve systems without requiring endless approvals has been liberating.

### Set Your Course

> *We are challenging the status quo. We have the team, the technology, the resources and the mandate to rethink healthcare and put the member first. Blaze the path forward.*

SafeRide Health doesn't just talk about innovation—we actively pursue it. One of our most ambitious projects has been implementing AI-powered customer service through our virtual representative, Steven.

Steven handles member calls, understands their transportation needs, and dispatches rides accordingly. While I can't speak to what other companies in the NEMT space are doing, I know that SafeRide Health is pushing boundaries that many organizations wouldn't even consider.

This willingness to experiment with cutting-edge technology while maintaining reliability and member satisfaction exemplifies the "Set Your Course" mentality.

### Lead with Compassion

> *SafeRide Health is powered by trust, empathy, and kindness. Every day, we provide unwavering support to our members, suppliers, clients, and teams that empowers them to lead their best lives.*

As engineers, it's easy to forget that our work directly impacts people's lives. SafeRide Health's members often depend on our services to reach critical medical appointments. This reality keeps us grounded.

But compassion isn't just for our members—it extends throughout the organization. I've consistently experienced support from colleagues across different departments:

- Operations teams providing context about real-world usage patterns
- Product managers listening to technical constraints and working collaboratively on solutions
- Fellow engineers offering help, even when they're busy with their own priorities

This culture of mutual support makes SafeRide Health feel less like a corporation and more like a community working toward a shared mission.

### Act with Integrity

> *We do what's right for our members. Our actions demonstrate honesty, respect, transparency, and reliability, no matter who's watching.*

Integrity is where SafeRide Health truly shines. The level of transparency I've experienced here is unprecedented in my career.

**Radical Transparency**: We hold all-hands meetings monthly where our leadership team, including CEO Robbins Schrader, walks through detailed financials. We see where revenue increased or decreased, which business units are thriving, and which need attention. When significant company challenges arise, leadership communicates openly rather than letting rumors fill the information vacuum.

**Honest Accountability**: Even in our blameless culture, individuals take ownership when things go wrong. It's not about pointing fingers—it's about honest assessment of what happened and how we can improve.

**Reliability**: When a colleague commits to something, it gets done. There's no need for multiple follow-ups or escalations. This reliability extends from individual contributors to senior leadership, creating a foundation of trust that makes collaboration effortless.

## Looking Forward

My journey at SafeRide Health has been transformative. I've grown from a PHP specialist to a TypeScript engineer comfortable working in microservices architecture. I've learned that great engineering isn't just about technical skills—it's about collaboration, empathy, and continuous learning.

More importantly, I've found a company that aligns with my values: challenging work, work-life balance, continuous learning, and making a meaningful impact on people's lives.

For anyone considering a career in healthcare technology, I can't recommend SafeRide Health enough. We're not just building software—we're helping people get to the care they need, when they need it. And we're doing it with a team and culture that makes the hard work genuinely enjoyable.
