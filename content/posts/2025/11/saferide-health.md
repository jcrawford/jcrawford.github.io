## When Did This Journey Begin?
I started my employment with Saferide Health back in February of 2022.  I have to say that over the past few years I have determined that this is the best company that I have worked for over my entire career.

## What makes it so good you ask?  
Well to start off I am the type of person who has to feel challenged pretty frequently.  Not so much on a daily basis but surely on a weekly basis.  If I am not challenged I start to feel bored.

Saferide has challenged me beyond my expectations.  When I started with the company we had a few legacy codebases which were written in PHP utilizing Laravel.  While these code bases still live on we are slowly working to phase them out.

I as able to assist in the migration from monoliths to microservices.  This has been a challenge on it's own.  We have gone through many different tasks to get where we are today and we still have more to do on the microservices front.

Through this process we have found that we have made some decisions that were not the greatest and are now working on removing those from our architecture.

Second I have a large busy family and there has to be a work/life balance.  Saferide Health has offered a great balance where as long as you get your work done they do not care if it is done in the wee hours of the morning or late at night and you communicate when you will be away from your desk.

## Microservices

As stated above we have started to make the move to microservices, we are using TypeScript to develop these services and they are running on Deno 2.x currently.

When I joined the team my expertise was in the realm of PHP and Laravel, however, I have had to learn TypeScript rather quickly so that I could assist in contributing to the microservices.

I wanted to get up to speed quickly so I requested that they get me the TotalTypescript course by Matt Pocock.  I have been going through that for the better half of the year and have to say that I am quite impressed with how the course is put together and just how quickly I was able to get up to speed.

## The Team
We have built a world class team at Saferide Health, while I am a Lead Engineer I am still learning things on a weekly basis from other engineers or code that others have written.

The engineers that we have on the team are all experts in one area or another but combined we are truly a solid team.  

At Saferide Health we do not condone finger pointing, if something goes wrong it does not matter who caused the issue, what matters is fixing the issue by collaborating as a team.

## The Values
Saferide Health has a core set of values which are followed by everyone at the company.  These values are the following.

#### Take The Wheel
  *We take action.  When faced with a problem take the wheel, identify and drive the solutions, and then share it with your team.*

  Saferide Health truly  adopts this value at it's core.  There have been countless times where I would be working on a feature, see something that is a mess and cleaned it up or re-architected how it works.  There has never been any complaints that I am going out of the scope of my tickets.  You do have to weigh how much scope creep is going to be added and if it is too much for the current task you would create a ticket for the backlog so that you can solve the issue at a later time.

#### Set Your Course
*We are challenging the status quo.  We have the team, the technology, the resources and the mandate to rethink healthcare and put the member first. 
Blaze the path forward.*

We are constantly trying to challenge the status quo, most recently we have employed the use of AI technologies so that we can have our AI Customer Service Representative (Steven) answer member calls and dispatch the rides they require.  This is something that I have only seen at Saferide Health, but then again I do not know what others are using for solutions like this.  I only know how we are pushing the boundaries.

#### Lead with Compassion
*Saferide Health is powered by trust, empathy, and kindness.  Every day, we provide unwavering support to our members, suppliers, clients, and teams that empowers them to lead their best lives.*

We have many different teams at Saferide Health, the engineering team is only one cog in the wheel.  From my side I have seen everyone on the team be willing to assist with any issue, provide any access that you may need or even just be an ear to listen to issues you may have.

#### Act with Integrity
*We do what's right for our members. Our actions demonstrate honesty, respect, transparency, and reliability, no matter who's watching.*

I have to say that this is one value I have seen and used throughout my time at Saferide Health.  Whenever an issue comes up someone is always ready to take the blame, even though we do not point fingers the honesty that comes from this team is amazing.  Everyone I have been in contat with at the company has always been respectful.  When it comes to transparency we hold an all hands meeting once a month where Robbins will go over all of the financials, where we gained profits or lost profits.  When there are company issues that are important they always ensure to inform everyone.  I have never seen a company as transparent as this one is.  I would consider everyone that I work with to be quite reliable, if they say they will do something it gets done without having to ask several times.
