Fashion is often about seeing what others overlook. The way light catches a fabric, the perfect drape of a sleeve, the unexpected combination of textures—these details separate those who simply wear clothes from those who understand style.

Developing this eye takes practice. Visit museums, study photography, observe people on the street. Notice what draws your attention and why. Is it color? Proportion? The way someone carries themselves? These observations inform your personal aesthetic.

Beauty in fashion isn't always obvious. Sometimes it's in the imperfections—the vintage piece with a story, the handmade item with slight irregularities that prove its authenticity. Learning to appreciate these nuances elevates your relationship with clothing from transactional to meaningful.
