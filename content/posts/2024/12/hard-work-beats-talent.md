Sports history is filled with naturally gifted athletes who never reached their potential, while 'underdog' competitors with less raw talent achieved greatness through relentless work. Talent might determine your starting point, but work ethic determines how far you go.

The training you do when no one's watching—the extra reps, the film study, the early mornings and late nights—that's what separates good from great. Talent provides a foundation, but discipline builds the structure. Consistency compounds into excellence.

This principle applies everywhere: in business, academics, creative pursuits, relationships. The person who shows up daily, even when motivation wanes, will eventually surpass someone coasting on natural ability. Progress beats perfection. Persistence beats potential.
