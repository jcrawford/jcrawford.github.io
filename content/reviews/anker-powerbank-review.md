The Anker PowerCore 737 is a premium power bank that doesn't compromise. With 24,000mAh capacity and 140W USB-C Power Delivery, it charges everything from smartphones to MacBook Pros at full speed. After six months of travel and remote work, it's become essential equipment for staying productive anywhere.

## Capacity: Charge Everything Multiple Times

The 24,000mAh (86.4Wh) capacity is just below airline carry-on limits (100Wh), making it perfect for travel. Here's what you can charge:

- **MacBook Pro 16"**: 1.2 full charges
- **MacBook Air 13"**: 2+ full charges
- **iPhone 15 Pro**: 5-6 full charges
- **iPad Pro**: 1.5-2 full charges
- **Nintendo Switch**: 4+ full charges

For a day working from a coffee shop or a long flight, the PowerCore 737 means never worrying about battery anxiety.

## 140W USB-C PD: Laptop Charging Speed

The game-changer is the 140W USB-C Power Delivery output. This charges:
- **MacBook Pro 16" M3**: Full charging speed (140W)
- **MacBook Pro 14" M3**: Full speed (96W)
- **MacBook Air**: Full speed (67W)
- **iPad Pro**: Fast charging (45W)
- **Smartphones**: Rapid charging (20-30W)

This eliminates the compromise of slow charging from power banks. Your MacBook charges as if plugged into the wall. For remote workers and travelers, this is transformative.

## Three Ports: Simultaneous Charging

The PowerCore 737 provides:
- **USB-C 1**: Up to 140W output
- **USB-C 2**: Up to 30W output
- **USB-A**: Up to 18W output

When charging multiple devices, the power distribution is intelligent:
- **One device**: Full 140W available
- **Two devices**: 100W + 40W split
- **Three devices**: 100W + 30W + 10W split

This means simultaneously charging your laptop at near-full speed while topping up your phone and wireless earbuds.

## Digital Display: Know Your Battery

The integrated display shows:
- Remaining battery percentage
- Input/output wattage in real-time
- Charging time estimate

No more guessing how much charge remains or whether fast charging is active. The display provides confidence that your power bank can handle upcoming needs.

## Build Quality

The PowerCore 737 feels premium:
- **Materials**: Durable plastic with matte finish (resists fingerprints)
- **Weight**: 1.3 pounds (590g)—substantial but expected for the capacity
- **Size**: Roughly the size of a thick smartphone (6.3" x 2.2" x 1.9")
- **Ports**: Recessed slightly to protect from damage

The build inspires confidence it'll survive years of travel in bags, backpacks, and carry-ons.

## Real-World Usage Scenarios

**Remote Work**: Power a full workday at a coffee shop without finding outlets. Charge MacBook, phone, and headphones simultaneously.

**Travel**: Keep laptop, phone, tablet, and e-reader charged during long flights. The 86.4Wh capacity maximizes airline carry-on limits.

**Emergency Backup**: Home power outage? Keep essential devices charged for communications and emergency needs.

**Outdoor Work**: Photography, videography, or field work where outlets are unavailable.

## Charging the Power Bank

Recharging the PowerCore 737 takes about 90 minutes via 140W USB-C input (using appropriate charger). With a standard 65W charger, it takes 2-3 hours.

Pass-through charging works—plug the power bank into a wall outlet while charging your devices. The power bank charges itself while simultaneously powering your devices. This is convenient for overnight charging setups.

## Weight and Portability

At 1.3 pounds, the PowerCore 737 is not lightweight. It's heavier than an iPad and occupies significant bag space. This is the trade-off for high capacity and laptop charging power.

For daily commutes or light travel, it's manageable but noticeable. For situations where you absolutely need power, the weight is worth it. I don't EDC (everyday carry) it, but it goes in my backpack for any day I'll be away from outlets for extended periods.

## Price Justification

At $149, the PowerCore 737 is expensive for a power bank. However, comparable high-wattage power banks cost similar amounts:

- **Baseuses 20,000mAh 100W**: $119
- **Ugreen 145W 25,000mAh**: $129
- **RAVPower 90W 20,000mAh**: $99

The PowerCore 737's 140W output, build quality, and Anker's reputation justify the premium. Cheaper options exist, but they typically compromise on wattage, capacity, or reliability.

For professionals whose laptops are productivity tools, the premium is worthwhile insurance against lost work time.

## Safety Features

Anker includes:
- **MultiProtect**: Surge protection, short circuit prevention, temperature control
- **ActiveShield 2.0**: Monitors temperature 3 million times per day
- **Certified safe**: Airline approved, multiple safety certifications

I've never experienced overheating, even when charging three devices simultaneously in hot environments.

## Who Should Buy the PowerCore 737?

**Perfect for:**
- Remote workers needing reliable laptop power
- Frequent travelers (especially flights)
- Photographers/videographers working in field
- Digital nomads working from various locations
- Anyone with high-power USB-C laptops
- Emergency preparedness

**Consider alternatives if:**
- You only need phone charging (smaller, cheaper options)
- Weight is a critical concern (get lower capacity)
- Budget is under $100
- You rarely work away from outlets
- You don't own USB-C devices

## Alternatives

**Anker PowerCore 20,000mAh 100W** ($99): Lighter, cheaper, less wattage

**Anker Nano Power Bank 10,000mAh** ($45): Ultra-portable, phone-focused

**Ugreen 25,000mAh 145W** ($129): Similar specs, alternative brand

**Goal Zero Sherpa 100PD** ($299): Ruggedized, solar-compatible, premium

## Final Verdict

The Anker PowerCore 737 is the best high-capacity power bank for professionals with high-power USB-C devices. The 140W output means no compromises—your MacBook Pro charges at full speed just like plugged into a wall.

The combination of capacity, power output, multiple ports, and build quality justify the $149 price for anyone who regularly works remotely or travels. The weight is the only significant compromise, and it's an acceptable trade-off for the capability.

After months of relying on it for remote work and travel, the PowerCore 737 has earned permanent space in my backpack. It's eliminated battery anxiety entirely and enabled working from anywhere with confidence.

If you own a high-power USB-C laptop and frequently work away from outlets, the PowerCore 737 is one of the best investments you can make in your mobile productivity setup.

**Rating: 5/5** - Best high-capacity power bank for laptop users
