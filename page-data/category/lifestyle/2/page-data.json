Baristas perfect their pour-overs and latte art. Home enthusiasts invest in grinders, scales, and various brewing methods. The simple act of making coffee becomes a mindful practice, a moment of care we give ourselves before facing the day's demands.</p>\n<p>But it's not just about the drink itself.
