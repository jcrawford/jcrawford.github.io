Talent might determine your starting point, but work ethic determines how far you go.</p>\n<p>The training you do when no one's watching—the extra reps, the film study, the early mornings and late nights—that's what separates good from great. Talent provides a foundation, but discipline builds the structure. Consistency compounds into excellence.</p>\n<p>This principle applies everywhere: in business, academics, creative pursuits, relationships.
