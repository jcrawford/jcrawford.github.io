  "excerpt": "Travel expands your perspective and rewrites your understanding of the world.",
  "content": "<p>Staying in one place your entire life is like reading a single page of an epic novel—you miss the plot twists, character development, and diverse settings that make the story complete. Travel doesn't just show you new places; it reveals new ways of being, thinking, and living.</p><p>Each destination adds chapters to your life story. In Japan, you learn patience through tea ceremony. In Italy, you discover the art of savoring meals. In Morocco, you navigate ancient souks and practice bargaining. These experiences reshape your worldview, challenging assumptions you didn't know you held.</p><p>Travel also teaches adaptability and resilience. You learn to navigate foreign transit systems, communicate across language barriers, and find comfort in discomfort. These skills transfer to all areas of life, making you more confident and capable.</p>",
