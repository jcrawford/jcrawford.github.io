  "content": "<p>Fashion is temporary—a season's hottest trend becomes next year's thrift store find. But style? Style is eternal. It's the throughline that connects your wardrobe choices across decades, the signature that makes people recognize your aesthetic even when you're experimenting.</p><p>Building personal style requires self-awareness. It means understanding your lifestyle, your body, your values, and letting those inform your clothing choices rather than blindly following what magazines dictate. Do you value comfort? Sustainability? Making a statement? These priorities shape authentic style.</p><p>Consider investing in a capsule wardrobe of well-made basics that reflect your aesthetic. A perfect white shirt, jeans that fit like they were made for you, a coat that makes you stand taller—these pieces become the foundation of style that transcends trends. You can accessorize with trendy pieces, but your core remains constant.</p><p>Style also means knowing yourself well enough to take risks that feel right for you, not risks that fashion demands. Maybe you love mixing patterns when conventional wisdom says to play it safe. Maybe minimalism speaks to you when maximalism dominates. Trust your instincts.</p><p>Ultimately, style is about self-expression and confidence. When you dress in a way that feels authentically you, that confidence shows. And confidence never goes out of fashion.</p>",
