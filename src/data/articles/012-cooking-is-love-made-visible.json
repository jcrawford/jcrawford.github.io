  "excerpt": "Embrace creativity, experimentation, and joy in the kitchen.",
  "content": "<p>The best cooking doesn't come from rigid recipe-following—it comes from intuition, experimentation, and willingness to make glorious mistakes. When you cook with abandon, you taste as you go, adjust seasonings boldly, and trust your instincts. This is how family recipes evolved, how signature dishes were born.</p><p>Don't be intimidated by precise measurements and complicated techniques. Start with quality ingredients, apply heat, season generously. The rest is practice and personal touch. Your 'imperfect' handmade pasta tastes better than store-bought because it's made with care.</p><p>Cooking is also about letting go of perfection. The slightly burnt edges, the sauce that's thicker than intended, the presentation that's rustic rather than restaurant-worthy—these don't diminish a meal's deliciousness. They prove it's made by human hands, with love.</p>",
